# Stars Extractor
This project only contains some scripts to extract stars from the original images (stars_extractor.py), filter the original star images (create_dir_for_labeled_star_images.py) and also for measuring and approximating an integer gaussian distribution of all kinds of stars in the images (stars_clustered_distribution.py). The files can be run without additional arguments (e.g. python stars_extractor.py). Please refer to their individual documentation for adjustment of the default arguments.
