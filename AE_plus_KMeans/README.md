# Autoencoder plus KMeans
The purpose of this project is to find a compact representation for a dataset in order to cluster it with kmeans. 
Use ae.py to train an autoencoder on an image directory containg 28x28 images 
and use kmeans.py to then cluster the same images with the help of the saved encoder. Please refer to the classes' 
individual documentation for detailed use.
